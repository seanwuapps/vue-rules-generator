# Project Summary: Vue Rules Generator

This document provides a summary of the Vue Rules Generator project, including its purpose, implemented features, and the technologies used.

## Project Purpose

The Vue Rules Generator is a web-based tool built with Nuxt.js that allows users to configure a set of rules, export them as a configuration file, and import existing configurations. It is designed to streamline the process of managing and sharing rule sets for a Vue.js project.

## Implemented Features

Based on the completed tasks, the following features have been implemented:

*   **Project Initialization**: The project was initialized as a Nuxt.js application.
*   **UI Framework**: Nuxt UI has been integrated for the user interface components.
*   **Main Layout**: A main layout and page structure have been created.
*   **Preferences Data Structure**: A data structure for managing user preferences has been defined.
*   **Preferences Editor**: A UI for editing preferences has been implemented.
*   **Rule Generation**: Logic for generating a rules file has been implemented.
*   **File Download**: Functionality to download the generated rules file has been added.
*   **Configuration Export/Import**: Users can export their preferences to a JSON file and import them back into the tool.
*   **UI Refinements**:
    *   A navigation header has been added.
    *   Import functionality has been moved to a separate page.
    *   The UI has been refined for better extensibility.
    *   Collapsible sections for rule categories with enable/disable toggles have been implemented.
*   **Technical Improvements**:
    *   Server-Side Rendering (SSR) has been enabled to fix 404 errors on page refresh.
    *   The import/export format has been refined to include an `enabled` flag and structured rules.
